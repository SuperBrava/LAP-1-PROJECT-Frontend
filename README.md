## Description

Create a community platform to display journal entries from other users - utilising front/backend to store json data - deployed to netlify herouku

## Requirements
Your website should have the following functionality for users:
- [ ] Users should be able to visit the website and anonymously post journal entries.
- [ ] Users should be limited to how many characters they can put in an entry.
- [ ] Users should be able to add gifs from giphy in an entry.
- [ ] Users should be able to view other peoples' entries.
- [ ] Users should be able to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.
- [ ] Users should have three emojis to choose from.
- [ ] Users should be able to comment on other people’s entries.

Your project should meet the following technical requirements:
- [ ] Aim for minimum 60% test coverage (In future projects this will be enforced with an aim for 80%)
- [ ] Your repos should have excellent READMEs. See our Writing READMEs guide for details.
- [ ] Your website should be deployed (You could use eg. Netlify for client, Heroku for server)
- [ ] Your codebase should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course: HTML, CSS & vanilla JS
- [ ] You may bring in some node libraries for specialised behaviour eg. dayjs but no large front end frameworks such as React.
